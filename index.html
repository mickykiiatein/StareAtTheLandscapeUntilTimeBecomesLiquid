            with camera rolling<br>
            standing <br>
            on a hedge<br>
            on some grass<br>
            on on a street<br>
            in a woodland<br>
            in an industrial park<br>
            somewhere in or around Limerick, Ireland<br>
            looking<br>
            this thing i’ve found myself doing<br>
            a kind of ritual –<br>
            spending time<br>
            gawping<br>
            waiting for the landscape <br>to reveal things to me

            and there are many times more<br>
            where I choose not to lug my camera along with me<br>
            the goal wouldn’t exactly be to mediatise it all anyway would it?<br>
            it’s more about practising a way of living, seeing<br>
            and y’know in a way I suppose, amn’t I glad to be out and about<br>
            all the same<br>
            roaming the homeland<br>
            isn’t that it<br>
            gawping <br>

        <p>when I’m looking <br>
            I see things like<br>
            buildings (lots of kinds)<br>
            some are houses, others workplaces<br>
            manufacturing plants, waste facilities, offices<br>
            and infrastructural things <br>
            that make humming noises and have weird smells<br>
            like stuff for water and electricity probably<br>
            roads, big ones small ones medium ones<br>
            fields, agriculture, lots of cattle<br>
            hedges fences walls ditches dikes<br>
            rivers and streams running at their speeds<br>
            branches blowing about the place<br>
            all quite normal stuff really<br>
            and isn't that the point?</p>

        <p>
            some placenames: Kiltanna, Kilcoleman, Rathkeale, Castlematrix, Aughinish Alumina, Ballycar, Parteen, National Technology Park, Cratloe, Gortadroma, Keeper Hill, Ardnacrusha, Cruise’s Street, O’Callaghan Strand, Lough Gur, Annacotty Business Park

            <br>    
            I have had a long relationship<br>
            with many of these places<br>
            the images of these places are furnished <br>
            with personal memories and meaning<br>
            like all the times I stood on the sideline <br>
            at the local GAA pitch<br>
            or when I stayed in the village messing<br>
            when the school bus didn’t come during snow<br>
            or from the window at home every morning<br>
            seeing the Aughinish smokestacks rising in the distance<br>
            but that’s just me

            now I begin to feel something<br>
            maybe as my blood calms<br>
            and my senses slowly open<br>
            and instead of being a coloniser/voyeur of the landscape<br>
            with my video camera<br>
            I am a constituent part of it <br>

            the landscape offers up<br>
            artefacts, characteristics, traces<br>
            remnants of past (it’s all a remnant of past isn’t it?)<br>
            fragments of future<br>
            the landscape unfolds its many layers<br>
            it presents in a haunted flux state<br>
            an unnavigable tangled dynamic of potential pasts and futures<br>
            making up present reality<br>
            things which occurred that will occur again<br>
            somehow (must they?)<br>
            all the tragedies and oppressions and hardships<br>
            I don’t need to name<br>
            that permeate Irish consciousness <br>
            and the joy and glory days <br>
            dancing and music<br>
            feasting and jubilation<br>
            rewarding hard work<br>
            friendship and meitheal<br>
            <br>
            the land holds multiplicities<br>
            many-voiced (human and non-human)<br>
            some you hear, babbling to eternity<br>
            many held down deep<br>
            bogsunk mem’ry<br>
            secrets devour’d by worms<br>

            I’m quick to think of the landscape as human culture<br>
            landscape as a stage for human dramas to unfold<br>
            writ with layers of human stories<br>
            and I think of our agency over the land<br>
            our exploitation of it <br>
            our poisoning of it<br>
            the sick land<br>
            disaster spelled for the future<br>
            how might we change tactic<br>
            how might care for the sick land?<br>
            <br>
            but here, taking note of the land as it appears to be<br>
            it doesn’t necessarily appear overtly fussed about human culture<br>
            some buildings I see are as yet only half-built (hot market shit)<br>
            many others I see are neglected and forgotten <br>
            becoming reclaimed by creeping mosses and plants<br>
            and insects and birds and the odd rat no doubt<br>
            all are works-in-progress nonetheless<br>
            without us, things carry on nonetheless<br>
            things will change<br>
            <br>
            we can draw as many dividing lines as we like<br>
            across the surface of the land<br>
            despite our best efforts, the land cannot be owned<br>
            we are not its master<br>
            the land is unownable<br>
            we do not write its history<br>
            the landscape is beyond us

            staring<br>
            staring at the landscape <br>
            gawping at the landscape <br>
            until time becomes liquid<br>
            <br>
            it’s full of non-human life<br>
            plants and animals and fungi<br>
            but humans are part of it too<br>
            long ago it probably used to have different animals<br>
            like cows that look a bit funny or different<br>
            butterflies that were massive<br>
            and the humans were different too<br>
            I think of the old Irish pagans and <br>
            how I like their idea of time<br>
            as cyclical, moving with the seasons<br>
            and I think of them eating all the different kinds of mushrooms<br>
            and having mad psychedelic sensuous experiences<br>
            where they felt deeply connected to a more than human landscape<br>
            and drew mad spiral shapes on stones<br>
            I’d be interested to hear what kind of sounds they made<br>
            maybe they still echo, too<br>
            <br>
            and do I long for some kind of regression into tribalism<br>
            is that what this is all about?<br>
            would that solve whatever problems I think there are?<br>
            for now, I’m not sure how that can happen<br>
            with us having starbucks and iPads and all<br>
            anyway<br>
            I quietly reach over<br>
            and press stop record<br>
